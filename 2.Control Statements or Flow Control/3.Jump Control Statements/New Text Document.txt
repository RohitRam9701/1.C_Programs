Jump Control Statements:

These allow the program to jump to another part of the program, skipping the execution of certain statements.
Jump control statements in C are:
break statement: Terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch-case statement.
continue statement: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.
goto statement: Provides an unconditional jump to a labeled statement within the same function.



goto label;
// ...
label:
    // Code to jump to
return statement: Exits a function and optionally returns a value to the function's caller.
