**Range of Numbers** 
Problem: A survey of the computer market shows that personal computers are sold at varying costs by the vendors. The following is the list of costs 
         (in hundreds) quoted by some vendors:
          35.00,    40.50,    25.00,    31.25,    68.15, 
          47.00,    26.65,    29.00,    53.45,    62.50

         Determine the average cost and the range of values.

**Problem analysis**: Range is one of the measures of dispersion used in statistical analysis of a series of values. The range of any series is 
  the difference between the highest and lowest values in the series. That is          Range = highest value â€“ lowest value
  It is therefore necessary to find the highest and lowest values in the series.

**Program**: A program to determine the range of values and the average cost of a personal computer in the market is given below:*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int count;
    float value, high, low, sum, average, range;
    sum = 0;
    count = 0;
    printf("Enter numbers in a line : input a NEGATIVE number to end\n");
input:
    scanf("%f", &value);
    if (value < 0) goto output;
    count = count +1;
    if (count == 1)
    {
        high = low = value;
    }
    else if (value > high)
    {
        high=value;
    }
    else if (value < low)
    {
        low=value;
    }
    sum=sum+value;
    goto input;

output:
    average=sum/count; 
    range=high-low; 
    printf("\n\n");
    printf("Total Values : %d\n", count);
    printf("Highest-value: %f\nLowest-value : %f\n", high, low);
    printf("Range : %f\tAverage : %f", range, average);
    return 0;
}
/*
**Output**

When the value is read the first time, it is assigned to two buckets, high and low, through the statement
              high = low = value; 
For subsequent values, the value read is compared with high; if it is larger, the value is assigned to high. Otherwise, the value is compared with 
low; if it is smaller, the value is assigned to low. Note that at a given point, the buckets high and low hold the highest and the lowest values 
read so far. 
The values are read in an input loop created by the goto input; statement. The control is transferred out of the loop by inputting a negative 
number. This is caused by the statement 
                if (value < 0) goto output; 
Note that this program can be written without using goto statements. Try. 

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int count = 0;
    float value, high, low, sum = 0, average, range;

    printf("Enter numbers in a line : input a NEGATIVE number to end\n");

    while(1)
    {
        scanf("%f", &value);
        if (value < 0) break;

        count = count + 1;
        if (count == 1)
        {
            high = low = value;
        }
        else
        {
            if (value > high)
            {
                high = value;
            }
            else if (value < low)
            {
                low = value;
            }
        }
        sum = sum + value;
    }

    average = sum / count; 
    range = high - low; 

    printf("\n\n");
    printf("Total Values : %d\n", count);
    printf("Highest-value: %f\nLowest-value : %f\n", high, low);
    printf("Range : %f\tAverage : %f", range, average);

    return 0;
