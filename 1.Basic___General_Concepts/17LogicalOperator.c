/*
Logical(boolean logic) Operators:
    1. Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
    2. Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
    3. Logical NOT (!): Negates(nullifies) the value of the operand i.e. inverts the logic.

 An expression that combines two or more relational expressions is termed as a logical expression.‚ÇÅ
