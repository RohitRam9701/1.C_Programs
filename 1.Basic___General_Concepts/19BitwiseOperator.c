Twist in Bitwise Complement Operator in C Programming: The bitwise complement of 35 (~35) is -36 instead of 220, but why?

For any integer n, bitwise complement of n will be -(n + 1). To understand this, you should have the knowledge of 2's complement.  

                                    2's Complement
Two's complement is an operation on binary numbers. The 2's complement of a number is equal to the complement of that number plus 1. For example:

 Decimal         Binary           2's complement 
   0            00000000           -(11111111+1) = -00000000 = -0(decimal)
   1            00000001           -(11111110+1) = -11111111 = -256(decimal)
   12           00001100           -(11110011+1) = -11110100 = -244(decimal)
   220          11011100           -(00100011+1) = -00100100 = -36(decimal)

Note: Overflow is ignored while computing 2's complement.
The bitwise complement of 35 is 220 (in decimal). The 2's complement of 220 is -36. Hence, the output is -36 instead of 220.

Bitwise Complement of Any Number N is -(N+1). Here's how:

bitwise complement of N = ~N (represented in 2's complement form)
2'complement of ~N= -(~(~N)+1) = -(N+1)

Bitwise shifts or Shift operators : 1.shift left(<<) or left shift or Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the 
                                      number of bits specified by the right operand
                                      Left shift operator shifts all bits towards left by a certain number of specified bits. The bit positions 
                                      that have been vacated by the left shift operator are filled with 0. The symbol of the left shift operator 
                                      is <<.

                                      212 = 11010100 (In binary)
                                      212<<1 = 110101000 (In binary) [Left shift by one bit]
                                      212<<0 = 11010100 (Shift by 0)
                                      212<<4 = 110101000000 (In binary) =3392(In decimal)

                                    2.shift right(>>) or right shift or Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by 
                                      the number of bits specified by the right operand.
                                      Right shift operator shifts all bits towards right by certain number of specified bits. It is denoted by >>.

                                      212 = 11010100 (In binary)
                                      212 >> 2 = 00110101 (In binary) [Right shift by two bits]
                                      212 >> 7 = 00000001 (In binary)
                                      212 >> 8 = 00000000 
                                      212 >> 0 = 11010100 (No Shift)

Letâ€™s look at the truth table of the bitwise operators.

   X       Y       X & Y       X | Y       X ^ Y       

   0       0         0           0           0

   0       1         0           1           1

   1       0         0           1           1

   1       1         1           1           0
