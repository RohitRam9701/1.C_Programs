The code you provided invokes undefined behavior in C because it modifies the variable a multiple times between two sequence 
points without a sequence point in between. The C language standard does not define the order of evaluation for such expressions.

In this specific case, the behavior of the code can vary depending on the compiler and optimization settings. Different compilers 
may produce different results, or the same compiler may produce different results with different optimization levels.

Unary Plus Operator (+): Returns the value of its operand.	                     +h
Unary Minus Operator (â€“): Returns the negative of the value of its operand.	     -h

Although the unary minus operator and subtraction operator looks the same, their function is different from each other in the following ways:
1.As the name suggests, the unary operator works on a single operator while the subtraction operator is a binary operator that works on two operands.
2.The unary minus returns the negative of the value of its operand while the subtraction operator returns the difference between its two operands.

Do not use increment or decrement operators with any expression other than a variable identifier.

Do not use increment and decrement operators to floating point variables.

The modulus operator % can only be used with integers in C. It calculates the remainder when one integer is divided by another.

In C, if the value of a data item is 0 ,it is considered false, while any non-zero value is considered true.

A division operation involving integer operands truncates the resultant value. This situation can be avoided by using floating-point operands or 
typecasting the operands to floating-point before performing the division.

The statement ++a++ is invalid because you cannot apply both prefix and postfix increment operators on the same variable. The correct usage would 
be ++a or a++, but not both together.

The statement a = 1 / b assigns the value 0.5 to a:
Since a is an integer variable, the result of the division will be an integer division, meaning the fractional part will be truncated. The value 
of b is 20, so 1 / b is 1 / 20, which evaluates to 0 (truncated result). Therefore, the statement assigns the value 0 to a, not 0.5. So, the 
statement is false.

Which of the following calculations will not produce the exact result of the division?
a. 7.0/4     b. 7/4    c. 7/4.0    d. 7.0/4.0 
ans: b. 7/4
